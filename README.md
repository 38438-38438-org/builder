# builder
Builder is the system that builds automatically both iPXE binaries and the images for booting through iPXE.

## How to use
You can go to [builds.isardvdi.com](https://builds.isardvdi.com) and browse the NixOS images that iPXE clients are going to boot when using [isard-ipxe](https://github.com/isard-vdi/isard-ipxe).

## Thanks
